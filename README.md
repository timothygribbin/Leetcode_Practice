# Leetcode Practice

I do all of my leetcode problems in Java right now. I've taken just about every class in java, so I'm most comfortable with java by a mile, but Python may be something I consider down the line.

If you'd like to read more of my leetcode solutions, I have written some solutions on my public leetcode profile. You can view that here https://leetcode.com/u/tjgribbin/ under the solutions tab. Please reach out with any questions.
